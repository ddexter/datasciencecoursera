# Getting and Cleaning Data - Final Project
The final project for this course is to sanitize the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set by first extracting only the mean and std measurements while also concatenating the test and training sets.  The activity id's are replaced with meaningful names that explain what each activity entailed.  Once the mean and standard deviations of each measurement are extracted, the script creates a new tidy data set that finds the average across all the extracted measurements for each unique (subject, activity) pair.  The resulting table, written to tidy_avg_subject_activity.txt, has a mean for each mean() and std() measurement form the original data set and one row per (subject/activity).  The subject and activity are listed in separate columns to respect the tidy nature of the data
